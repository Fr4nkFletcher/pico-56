My [HBC-56](https://github.com/visrealm/hbc-56) (a 65C02/TMS9918A homebrew computer on a backplane) fully emulated on a Raspberry Pi Pico.

Making use of my various emulation libraries:

* [vrEmu6502](https://github.com/visrealm/vrEmu6502) - 6502/65C02 CPU emulation library (C99)
* [vrEmu6522](https://github.com/visrealm/vrEmu6522) - 6522/65C22 VIA emulation library (C99)
* [vrEmuTms9918](https://github.com/visrealm/vrEmuTms9918) - TMS9918A/TMS9929A VDP emulation library (C99)

This is the placeholder repository for the up-coming video series covering the development of the PICO-56.
