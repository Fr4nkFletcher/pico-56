### 3D Printed Case

I've had a first pass at designing a 3D printed case for the PICO-56. The PCB wasn't really designed with a case in mind, so there are some compromises. Primarily, it doesn't screw together. It clips together.

### Threaded inserts

The threaded inserts I've used are M3.5x5.7x4.6
